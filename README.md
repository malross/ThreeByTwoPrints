# Three by Two Prints

Activities people need to do might include:

First, we need to define which photos we want to print. And to do that, we not only need a way to select the photos, but 
we need a way to find the *best* photos. And that means being able to compare similar photos and select those we want or
reject those that are clearly pants. So,it can be a shortlisting process. And possibly looking at groups of files at a time.

So,maybe...

Select an entire folder
or
Select individual files

then...

sort or filter to reject or approve or shortlisting
select a subset to compare / find the best, allowing detailed view
mark as included (and then hide or move till later?)
mark as reject (and immediately take out of the list? or put in a rejected pile?)





* Select files from a folder
* Choose files either in Windows Explorer, the file open dialog, or just import everything
from a folder and then filter them down  in the application - which gives the best experience?
 - to be able to choose just the best, you need to be able to see them in enough detail to compare similar photos and select the best.
